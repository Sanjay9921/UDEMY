                <li>The <b> chicken </b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. </li>
                <li>Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.</li>
                <li>A male that has been castrated is a capon. </li>
                <li>An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</li>
                <li>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]</li>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
            An adult male is a called a 'cock' or 'rooster' (in the United States) and an adult female is called a 'hen'.[10][11]
        
        Other terms are:
        
        <ul>
            <li>'Biddy:' a newly hatched chicken <sup>[12][13]</sup></li> <!--Superscript-->
            <li>'Capon:' a castrated or neutered male chicken<sub>[a]</sub></li> <!--Subscript-->
            <li>'Chick:' a young chicken[14]</li>
            <li>'Chook' /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia, informal)[15]</li>
            <li>'Cockerel:' a young male chicken less than a year old[16]</li>
            <li>'Pullet:' a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]</li>
            <li>'Yardbird:' a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[19]</li>
            <li>"Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'.[20]</li>
        </ul>
        
        'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[21]
